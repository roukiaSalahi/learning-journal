# HTML
*hyper text markup language*

we use **html** to 
create web pages. 

You will see that you start by writing down 
the words you want to appear 
on your page. You then add tags 
or elements to the words so 
that the browser knows what is 
a heading, where a paragraph 
begins and ends, and so on.


  ***Note that before you start your project you should draw a wireframe***

   structure of the html:

- head
- body
   - header
   - main   
   - footer

   ## HTML5 LayouT eLements:
   *HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content you will find in them.*

   - <header>
   - <footer>
   - <nav>
   - <article>
   - <section>
   - <aside>
   - <div>
   - <figure> 
   - <figcaption>
   - <hgroup> h1,h2...h6

   ***Note the diffrences between article and section, so if you remove the article from your page it will still got the a full meaning.***
